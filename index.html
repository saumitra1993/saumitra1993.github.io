                      <small>Fun fact 1, I wrote two novels as a teenager. The first book was science fiction heavily inspired by Harry Potter while the second was a story-bound musing on facets of life. You can download them <a href="sistrovious.pdf" download>here</a> and <a href="Theshadowedapogeewfp.pdf" download>here</a>. <br /><br />
                        Fun fact 2 - my English teacher, who I had immense respect for, had claimed Shakespeare to be her favourite writer in an interview. I had originally started writing these novels in an attempt to change her choice from Shakespeare to me. If that's not ambition, I don't know what is. ;)

                        <p> I graduated from NIT Nagpur with a Computer Science degree and have worked almost exclusively at early-stage startups since then. I call myself an imaginative rationalist; basically creativity + technology usually amplifies the quality of my output. <br />
                          <br />In college, I co-founded a pioneering <a target="_blank" href="http://www.campusfeedapp.com">app</a> for college communication that has gone on to become a part of the college culture.
                          <br /><br /> I now help craft seamless shopping experiences at <a target="_blank" href="https://swym.it">Swym</a> for tens of thousands of e-commerce stores all over the world and delivering millions of dollars in attributable sales via our platform. <br /><br /> At Swym, I have fallen in love with functional programming and JavaScript. This fascination has led me to build systems that I myself marvel at. :)

                        <p>When building tools for entrepreneurs, you have the responsibility, more than anywhere else, of optimizing for ease of use. As Shopify app developers, creating tools that entrepreneurs use to power their businesses is what we do at Swym day in and out — so making our software easy and intuitive to use is a key business requirement to ensure that we maximize the adoption and engagement we get for our products. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shopify.in/partners/blog/design-system">Read more..</a></p>

                        <p>This post will focus on the implementation details of incorporating Polaris into our UI workflows, starting from mockups and wireframing all the way to writing code and creating reusable components. While Polaris provides guidance on component-wise usage and the APIs to use for it, the job of building large-scale applications with several moving parts has a lot more to it than that. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shopify.in/partners/blog/upgrade-to-shopify-polaris">Read more..</a></p>

                        <p>
Through 2017, I applied to two dozen start-ups, worked for two, saw a wide spectrum of leadership styles, cultures, values, ambitions and challenges. While I loved the diversity of problems startups aimed to address in 2017, the fresh band of people who pumped their energy into their work, the rise in startups working on social problems, I saw some very obvious gaps that we as a community need to work on. <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@saumitra.khanwalker/a-year-in-the-start-up-ecosystem-things-we-need-to-fix-in-2018-34d051294d1f">Read more..</a></p>

                        <p> To promote my college startup Campusfeed, my team and I came up with an interactive poster that leveraged origami to add real-estate on the poster to surface more information. Also, interaction led to a lot more people engaging with the poster.</p>
